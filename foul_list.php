<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">7.2 ROBOT Restrictions </span></p>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Don&rsquo;t overextend yourself. ROBOTS may not extend more than 16 in (41 cm). beyond their FRAME PERIMETER (see Figure 8-1). This rule doesn&rsquo;t apply to a ROBOT fully within its PLATFORM ZONE during the ENDGAME. </span></li>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Violation: FOUL. If strategic, (e.g. expansion results in scoring a POWER CUBE), RED CARD. </span></li>
</ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Keep it together. ROBOTS may not intentionally detach or leave parts on the FIELD. </span></li>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Violation: RED CARD </span></li>
</ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Keep your BUMPERS together. ROBOTS must be in compliance with BUMPER rules throughout the MATCH.</span></li>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Violation: FOUL. DISABLED if any BUMPER segment becomes completely detached, any side of a ROBOT is completely exposed (without BUMPER), or the Team number or ALLIANCE color becomes indeterminate. </span></li>
</ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Launching power cubes outside specified zones</span></li>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Violation: TECH FOUL per POWER CUBE. Repeated violations of this rule are likely to escalate rapidly to YELLOW or RED CARDS</span></li>
</ul>
</ul>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">7.3 ROBOT to ROBOT Interaction</span></p>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Don&rsquo;t tear others down to lift yourself up. Strategies aimed at the destruction or inhibition of ROBOTS via attachment, damage, tipping, or entanglements are not allowed.</span></li>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Violation: FOUL and YELLOW CARD. If harm or incapacitation occurs as a result of the strategy, YELLOW CARD is elevated to a RED CARD </span></li>
</ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Stay out of other ROBOTS. Initiating deliberate or damaging contact with an opponent ROBOT on or inside the vertical extension of its FRAME PERIMETER, including transitively through a POWER CUBE, is not allowed. </span></li>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Violation: FOUL and YELLOW CARD. </span></li>
</ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Don&rsquo;t collude with your partners to shut down major parts of game play. Two or more ROBOTS may not isolate or close off any major component of MATCH play, e.g. blocking the EXCHANGE, shutting down all access to POWER CUBES, quarantining all opponents to a small area of the FIELD, etc. </span></li>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Violation: YELLOW CARD for the ALLIANCE. </span></li>
</ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">If an opponent&rsquo;s down, back off. Fallen (i.e. tipped over) ROBOTS attempting to right themselves (either by themselves or with assistance from a partner ROBOT) have one ten (10) second grace period in which they may not be contacted by an opponent ROBOT. This protection lasts for either ten (10) seconds or until the protected ROBOT has completed the righting operation, whichever comes first. </span></li>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Violation: FOUL. If intentional, YELLOW CARD. </span></li>
</ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">There&rsquo;s a 5-count on pins. ROBOTS may not pin an opponent&rsquo;s ROBOT for more than five (5) seconds. A ROBOT will be considered pinned until the ROBOTS have separated by at least six (6) feet. The pinning ROBOT(s) must then wait for at least three (3) seconds before attempting to pin the same ROBOT again. Pinning is transitive through other objects. If the pinned ROBOT chases the pinning ROBOT upon retreat, the pinning ROBOT will not be penalized, and the pin will be considered complete.</span></li>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Violation: FOUL, plus an additional FOUL for every five (5) seconds in which the situation is not corrected. If extended, RED CARD. </span></li>
</ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Opponent&rsquo;s EXCHANGE ZONE: no camping. A ROBOT may not block their opponent&rsquo;s EXCHANGE ZONE for more than five (5) seconds. A ROBOT is considered &ldquo;blocking&rdquo; if any part of their ROBOT is breaking the plane of the EXCHANGE ZONE, and will continue to be considered blocking until the ROBOT has moved at least six (6) feet from the EXCHANGE ZONE. If an opposing ROBOT attempts to stop the blocking ROBOT from moving the required distance to clear the block, the blocking ROBOT will not be penalized, and the block will be considered complete. A ROBOT that is being pinned is exempt from G15. Once the pin is over, the 5-second count begins for this rule. </span></li>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Violation: FOUL, plus an additional FOUL for every five (5) seconds in which the situation is not corrected. If extended and egregious, YELLOW CARD.</span></li>
</ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">The NULL TERRITORY is safe. A ROBOT whose BUMPERS are breaking the plane of its NULL TERRITORY and not breaking the plane of the opponent&rsquo;s PLATFORM ZONE may not be contacted by an opposing ROBOT, regardless of who initiates the contact. A ROBOT forced into breaking the plane of an opponent&rsquo;s NULL TERRITORY resulting in it being wedged underneath the SCALE is not a violation of this rule. </span></li>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Violation: TECH FOUL </span></li>
</ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Don&rsquo;t climb on each other until the end. Unless during the ENDGAME, or attempting to right a fallen (i.e. tipped over) ALLIANCE partner, ROBOTS may neither fully nor partially strategically support the weight of partner ROBOTS. </span></li>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Violation: TECH FOUL. </span></li>
</ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Don&rsquo;t mess with opponents in their PLATFORM ZONE. During the ENDGAME, ROBOTS may not contact an opponent ALLIANCE ROBOT, completely contained within their ALLIANCE&rsquo;S PLATFORM ZONE, regardless of who initiates the contact. </span></li>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Violation: The contacted opponent ROBOT, and all partner ROBOTS it&rsquo;s fully supporting, are considered to have CLIMBED at the end of the MATCH. </span></li>
</ul>
</ul>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">7.4 FIELD Interaction</span></p>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Be careful about what you interact with. DRIVE TEAMS, ROBOTS, and OPERATOR CONSOLES are prohibited from the following actions with regards to interaction with ARCADE elements. </span></li>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Items A and B exclude DRIVE TEAM interaction with FIELD elements in their areas. Item C excludes use of the PLAYER STATION hook-and-loop tape, plugging in to the provided power outlet, and plugging the provided Ethernet cable in to the OPERATOR CONSOLE. Items A-D exclude RUNGS and POWER CUBES. </span></li>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Grabbing </span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Grasping </span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Attaching to (including the use of hook-and-loop tape against the FIELD carpet)</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Hanging </span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Deforming</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Becoming entangled </span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Damaging</span></li>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Violation: If prior to MATCH, and situation can be corrected quickly, it must be remedied before the MATCH will start. If during a MATCH, FOUL. If during a MATCH and extended or repeated, YELLOW CARD. If offense is via a ROBOT and the Head REFEREE determines that further damage is likely to occur, offending ROBOT will be DISABLED. Corrective action (such as eliminating sharp edges, removing the damaging MECHANISM, and/or re-Inspection) may be required before the ROBOT will be allowed to compete in subsequent MATCHES. </span></li>
</ul>
</ul>
</ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">POWER CUBES: use as directed. With the exception of placing a POWER CUBES on PLATES, ROBOTS may not deliberately use POWER CUBES in an attempt to ease or amplify the challenge associated with FIELD elements. </span></li>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Violation: TECH FOUL per POWER CUBE. Repeated or egregious violations of this rule are likely to escalate rapidly to YELLOW or RED CARDS.</span></li>
</ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Keep POWER CUBES in bounds. With the exception of feeding POWER CUBES through the lower opening of the EXCHANGE, ROBOTS may not intentionally eject POWER CUBES from the FIELD. </span></li>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Violation: FOUL per POWER CUBE. Repeated violations of this rule are likely to escalate rapidly to YELLOW or RED CARDS. </span></li>
</ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">One POWER CUBE per ROBOT. ROBOTS may not control more than one (1) POWER CUBE at a time. </span></li>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Violation: FOUL per additional POWER CUBE. Repeated violations of this rule are likely to escalate rapidly to YELLOW or RED CARDS &nbsp;</span></li>
</ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">POWER CUBES in opponent&rsquo;s POWER CUBE ZONE &ndash; off limits. ROBOTS may not remove POWER CUBES, or cause POWER CUBES to be removed, from the opponent&rsquo;s POWER CUBE ZONE. A POWER CUBE has been removed from the POWER CUBE ZONE when it starts fully contained by the POWER CUBE ZONE, and ends completely outside of the POWER CUBE ZONE. A POWER CUBE removed through transitive contact with another POWER CUBE and/or an opponent ROBOT is a violation of this rule. &nbsp;</span></li>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Violation: FOUL per POWER CUBE removed</span></li>
</ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">POWER CUBES stay on PLATES. Strategies aimed at removing POWER CUBES from PLATES are prohibited. </span></li>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Violation: TECH FOUL per POWER CUBE removed</span></li>
</ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">PLATES are moved by POWER CUBES, not ROBOTS. Except via the weight of placed POWER CUBES, ROBOTS may not directly or transitively cause or prevent the movement of PLATES. Movement, or prevention of movement, of PLATES because of momentary ROBOT action resulting in minimal PLATE displacement is not a violation of this rule. A ROBOT forced to affect the position of a PLATE because of contact by an opponent ROBOT either directly or transitively through a POWER CUBE or other ROBOT (e.g. a ROBOT wedged underneath the SCALE by the opposing ALLIANCE either intentionally or accidentally) is not a violation of this rule. &nbsp;</span></li>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Violation: FOUL per instance plus an additional TECH FOUL for every five (5) seconds in which the situation is not corrected. Repeated or extended violations of this rule are likely to escalate rapidly to YELLOW or RED CARDS. </span></li>
</ul>
</ul>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"></span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">7.5 AUTO Period Rules </span></p>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Behind the lines. During AUTO, DRIVE TEAM members in ALLIANCE STATIONS and PORTALS may not contact anything in front of the STARTING LINES, unless for personal or equipment safety. </span></li>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Violation: FOUL per item contacted. </span></li>
</ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">During AUTO, let the ROBOT do its thing. During AUTO, DRIVE TEAMS may not directly or indirectly interact with ROBOTS or OPERATOR CONSOLES unless for personal safety, OPERATOR CONSOLE safety, or pressing an E-Stop for ROBOT safety. &nbsp;</span></li>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Violation: FOUL and YELLOW CARD. </span></li>
</ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Disconnect or set down controllers. During AUTO, any control devices worn or held by the DRIVERS and/or HUMAN PLAYERS must be disconnected from the OPERATOR CONSOLE. </span></li>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Violation: FOUL. </span></li>
</ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Stay out of your opponent&rsquo;s side of the FIELD. During AUTO, no part of a ROBOT&rsquo;S BUMPERS may pass from the NULL TERRITORY to the opponent&rsquo;s side of the FIELD. </span></li>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Violation: FOUL. If contact is made with an opponent ROBOT in their side of the FIELD (either direct contact or transitive contact through a POWER CUBE), TECH FOUL. Violations of this rule are likely to escalate rapidly to YELLOW or RED CARDS. </span></li>
</ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">POWER CUBES are off-limits. During AUTO, DRIVE TEAMS may not contact any POWER CUBES, unless for personal safety. </span></li>
